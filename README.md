# stage_one_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Create a mobile application that prominently features your Slack identity, incorporates your Slack profile picture, and includes an “Open GitHub” button. When pressed, this button should utilize a WebView component to redirect users to your GitHub profile within the application itself.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
